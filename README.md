# REC Website

## Mission Statement

The Rensselaer Engineering Commons (REC) is a proposed initiative aimed at fostering a collaborative hands-on environment for students and professionals interested in engineering and technology. Our mission is to create a community where members can work on real-world projects, share knowledge, and develop practical skills through collaboration with different majors. This club will serve as a platform for innovation, learning, and professional growth.

## Product Description

This is the official home of the Rensselaer Engineering Commons (REC). This website will hold student projects, have project management software, will allow students to better find workshops and semesterly timelines for their projects.

We aim to level up our practical knowledge by applying the engineering design process. When we learn to build, fail, reflect, and reiterate we quickly learn why things work and create cool stuff.
